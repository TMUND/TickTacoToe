## TickTacoToe

* My first attempt at a game using JS, CSS, HTML, Canvas?

##TODO:

### Soon

* Set-up timer for each turn, figure out how to only have timer when someone's turn
* Show "good luck" banner at start of game using jQuery
* Arrange text-entry box differently

### Later

* Keep scores
* Style html/css for better view

### Maybe

* Create sign-in for session storage
