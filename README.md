## TickTacoToe

* My first attempt at a game using JS, CSS, HTML, Canvas?

##TODO:

### Soon

* Figure out how to end timer when game is over
* Erase names in "player name" area after browser refresh
* Put up initial screen overlay to explain game and say thank you instead of default dialog boxes
* Show "good luck" banner at start of game
* Fix style, colors, layout

### Later

* Keep scores

### Maybe

* Create sign-in for session storage
