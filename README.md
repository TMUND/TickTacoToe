My first attempt using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and jQuery to create a simple tick taco toe game

# TODO:

* Refactor JavaScript into a player object

## Later

* Fadeout board after win, display winning "tick" in board space
* Figure out how to end timer when game is over
* Erase names in "player name" area after browser refresh
* Put up initial about modal to explain game and say thank you instead of default dialog boxes
* Show "good luck" banner at start of game
* Fix style, colors, layout
* Keep scores

## Maybe

* Create sign-in for session storage
* Post score to Facebook, Twitter (social media links)
