## TickTacoToe

* My first attempt at a game using JS, CSS, HTML, Canvas?

##TODO:

# Soon

* Show "good luck" banner at start of game using jQuery
* Set-up timer for each turn
* Arrange text-entry box differently

## Later

* Keep scores
* Style html/css for better view

### Maybe

* Create sign-in for session storage
